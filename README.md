## /Sum/:
**Flow: God is Dead** is a largely experimental turn-based strategy, built entirely around concepts of entropy denial and raw energy management. Visualised in full 3D, it tends to combine surreal post-modernistic designs with clean retro GUI. Mostly reported as hardcore.

## /Featurae/:
-	5 root unit kinds with two warring promotion paths for each (reincarnates / ascendants).
-	Quantum-management unit propogation, heavily inspired by classic 'Sentinel' game.
-	Total renunciation of in-battle randomizing with chess-level fair play in mind.
-	Hardcoded first law of thermodynamics without single trace of second one.
-	Optical-based battle mechanics with offence commited by visual contact.
-	Distinctive reality deconstruction atmosphere.
-	One map editor for players and developer.
-	Random map generation mode.

## /Reassembling/:
**Flow: God is Dead** is written completely in *PureBasic v4.40*, though compatible with *5.2x (LTS)*.
It relies on Blitz3D freeware engine, which is bundled here as DLL.  
To compile project just use 'Main.pb' as root sourcefile.  

## /Requirements (tested)/:
**Proc. Unit >=** *Pentium IV*, *2.0GHz*  
**R.A.M. >=** *2.0GB*  
**Hard Drive >=** *135MB*  
**GCard:** *Radeon 9550+*  
**Tech:** *DX7*, *WinXP+*
