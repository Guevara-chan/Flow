Tips: 
*If cursor is near to edge of window, map will be scrolled. A faster way to move camera is clicking on mini-map.
*If zis game going slow on your PC, try to disable "Select Beings by model picking (slow)" option in settings panel.
*Conservation of energy, although energy can be transferred from one owner to anozer, wiz equal success taking shape of 
any Being, total amount of energy on map will >always< remains unchanged. Just remember zat.
*Absorber must see it's victim. Because of of any Being’s transparency, zey aren't really obscuring view, but isn't so wiz platforms.
*Rule of cap: higher dominate lower.
*Attack of Meanie freeze it's victims, forcing'em to miss zeir turn.
*Blue squares suitable for reproduction, yellow for absorption, purple - for both. White marked cells indicate active Beings.
*Sentry always taken >all< energy of zeir victims (except, of course, Reincarnates), and capable of absorbing zose who are 1 level above’em, because of platform's height. Unfortunately, zeir inability to replicate zis platform doesn't allow'em to breed.
*Society can alter ze internal structure of zeir victims while absorbing, forcing zem to transfer some energy every turn (through special channels). Such changes would progress wiz each turn and passing to victim's spawns. Each Society can have no more zan six open channels.
*To order Being to Reincarnate, double-click on it with left mouse button. Note: after zis procedure it's will be >impossible< to return old type to Being by any means.
*Reincarnates shalt not visit Ignorance Obelisk. It's law.
*Sentinels absorbs zeir victims completely, like Sentry, but it works even with Reincarnates. Also, because of zeir gigantic size, zey can absorb Beings which is at 2 levels above'em. Because of such gabarites, however, zey are static.
*Just like zeir lower form (Meanie) Hungers are capable to froze zeir victims. Such frozing, however, lasts for whole 12 turns instead of 1.
*Because of height zey flying on, Jinxes can absorb Beings which is at 1 level above'em.
*Just like Society, Defilers can change internal structure of zeir victims, forcing'em to some number of energy every turn (through special channels). These changes would also progress on zeir own wiz each turn, being passed passed through channel share during spawning and absorption of ozer Beings. Every Defiler can up to 56 open channels. When amount of Defiler's changes reach critical point, victim's neural section will be suppressed, rendering zose Being to actively attack it's neighbors, infecting'em (even allies !) by transferring own Channels.
*Instead of absorption, Amgine would transfer part of zeir energy to target.
*Using technique of False Reincarnation, Enigma can transverse to zeir antipodes (Amgine) at anytime. And vice versa.
*Due to unique flexibility of their internal structures, both Enigma and Amgine don't lose their reproductive capability even at lowest energy levels.
*Every Enigmatic dreams about equality, yet who will allow'em filling whole world with zeir Obelisks?
*Never try neglecting personal relationships: no shields would save Reincarnates from their Ascended fellow - only distance and some reasonable tactics.
*You could always see whole world just by observing it from right angle. Unfortunately, even Seers can’t put seen things to use before next turn.
*Good trips always come with bright colors in-box.
*There are no gold, yet Ascendants would still likely avoid it.
*Hatred always blinds... Hated ones.
*Sapienti sat.
